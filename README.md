# AWS-Capstone-Project
This is documentation of building a highly available, scalable web application using AWS' cloud services for Example XYZ University.


# VPC
First step, I needed to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to hold my infrastructure. To note, this infrastructure is placed in one region and uses two availability zones for fault tolerance. The web application instance also lies on two public subnets.

The VPC that I created has private subnets, but they are not utilized for simplicity. Using private subnets and a NAT gateway would have been more secure for the web application, but itâ€™s complex, takes up too much time, and is costly.

After the VPC specifications were establishes, I had to create the VPC security group. I named it _Web Security Group_. Within _Inbound rules_, I allowed **HTTP from any IPv4** source which would permit web requests to the website. Using my own security group rather than the default security group allowed me to customize what protocols were allowed to communicate with the web application. 

# EC2
The next key part of the infrastructure was the computing power. I began by launching an EC2 instance labeled, _University Lab Instance_. I chose the **Ubuntu Amazon Machine Image** and chose the default **t2.micro** instance type and key pair. The university is small, so the free default options are suitable for the scenario. 

**EC2 Settings**
+ Networking Settings
    + Enabled Auto-assign public IP
    + Selected Web Security Group for the EC2 security group
+ Advanced Details
    + Entered Example University's website script in the User data box:
